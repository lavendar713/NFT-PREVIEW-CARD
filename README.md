## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this, i learnt more on the use of opacity to hide some specific elements until it's active state where it becomes visible.
Also learnt how to make a perfect circle with the border-radius element. Setting the height and width of an element to the same value, you set the border-radius value to 50% and you have yourself a perfect circle.

### Continued development

I'm honestly falling in love with the coding experience. The ability to create something from absolutely nothing just gets me excited. 
I'm impressed at the pace i'm moving forward and i know in a short while, I'll be at the level i desire.
